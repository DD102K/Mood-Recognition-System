# Mood-Recognition-System

Using ML python libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Tensorflow, OS, I have created an emotion detection system. It can detect six emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, Sad, Surprise.
I have used a Convolution Neural Network to create the model which is loaded using model.h5 file. Then, the detection part was done using haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file.
I have also written a code block for live emotion detection on camera.
